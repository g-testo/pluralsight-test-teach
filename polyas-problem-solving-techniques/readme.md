# Polya’s Problem Solving Techniques

## Lesson Objectives:
- Understand Polya’s four steps to problem solving
- Be able to identify and implement these techniques to solve problems

## Prerequisites:

- Variables
- Control Flow
    - If statements
    - Loops
- Functions
    - Parameters, arguments
- Helper methods

## Before we get started:

<details>
    <summary>What is an algorithm?</summary> <br />

Simple definition: Procedure used for solving a problem.

Format of a programming algorithm: <br />

``` js

// Problem Description: Please create an algorithm that takes in two numbers and returns the sum.

// This is our algorithm:
function sum(input1, input2){
    // This is where you return an output from your algorithm
    return input1 + input2;
}

// This is the invoking of our algorithm:
let output = sum(5, 7);

```

    <summary>Why is learning problem solving techniques important?</summary> <br />
    
- Your mind can go blank when put on the spot to solve a problem. An exmaple would be during an interview. This will give you an instinctual fallback under pressure.

- Some difficult problems can be intimidating and you wouldn't even know where to start. This is great starting point for any problem.
