// Sum of two numbers

// Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns the sum.


// Step One: Understand the problem

// Can you paraphrase the problem?

// How many input values will the algorithm expect to receive?
// What data type are the inputs?
// What data type and what shape is the output?
// Is there anything you don't understand that you may have to Google?

// What is the good case for solving the problem?
// What kind of edge cases can you think of?
// Are there any other cases that you can think of that you may want to handle?
// Can you write out an example or two of input(s) and output for each case you came up with?

// Step Two: Devise a plan
// Are there any helper methods that come to mind when understanding the problem?
// Are you able to pseudocode an algorithm that meets all of the cases you came up with?

// Step Three: Carry out the plan
// Where you able to write the code for the pseudocode that you created?
// Do you need to practice/Google how to use a certain helper method?
// Did the plan you devised work?
// Will you have to create a new plan?

// Step Four: Look back
// Is the algorithm scalable with reference to time-complexity/space-complexity 
// How can you refactor the code to make it more time/space efficient?
// Can you refactor the algorithm to be more readable or maintainable?

// Abbreviate a Two Word Name

// Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.
// The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

// Example
// Sam Harris => S.H
// patrick feeney => P.F
